### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying **Computer Science** at the [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/). 
My initial degree was in **Public and Environmental Health**, however, during the [Ebola Outbreak](https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/history/2014-2016-outbreak/index.html) in **West Africa** while I was working for the [Ministry of Health of The Gambia](http://www.moh.gov.gm/), I realized the need for a healthcare domain expert with computer science skills. Thus, I decided to enroll in a computer science degree. It was one of the most difficult decisions makings I ever faced, but I am happy to tell you that I have not regretted it at all.

Well before I dive deep into the field of computer science, my major interest was in healthcare application development and its related. I am now a Data Science enthusiast and my general research interest is in applied **Artificial Intelligence** for *Healthcare*, *life Science*, *Social Networks*, using **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** methods. Main focus on graph neural networks, graph database technologies, data mining, and big data analytics.
