# Welcome to my blog 

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

In this section, I will be sharing some intuitive tricks and methods related to **AI**, **Machine Learning**, **Web Development**, and **Others**.

I will try my best to make is it less wordy while getting to the root of the concepts with real-world examples and easy to read and understand codes. 

To navigate into any article of your choice, click on the title listed on your right hand side.

And the nice thing is, the entire code will be in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) format. Therefore, you can fork the entire notebook and reproduce the code for your own need. 

Please incase you read or use part of my code, be kind enough to give me a star on my [Github](https://github.com/mbjallow6/mbjallow6).
